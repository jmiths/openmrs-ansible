This is designed to run on a guest VM in virtualbox
Please use the desktop version and the primary user as openmrs
The script will use /home/openmrs/.ssh/github to pull from github, so please put your github key there.
Alternatively, you can shared your .ssh directory with the VM and have the key their called github

It is configured to go to 2222 on remote machines, so set up port forwarding so that you can go there.
Finally, add your public key for ssh to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys

The primary purpose of this script was to configure shared folders (from the host), but maven can't deploy when the user doesn't own the files.
